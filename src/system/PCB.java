    * 3.1.3 Process Control Block: it is linked to a process as it is in the queue
        * Each process is represented in the operating system by a
        * process control block ( PCB )â€”also called a task control block.
        * A PCB is shown in Figure 3.3. It contains many pieces of information
        * associated with a specific process
            * Process state: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated
            * Program counter : indicates the address of the next instruction
                            * to be executed
            * CPU registers : The 32 registers as in EECS-2021
            * CPU-Scheduling info: includes
                * a process priority,
                * pointers to scheduling queues, and
                * any other scheduling parameters. (See Ch 6)
            * Memory-management info
            * Accounting info
                * CPU time used
                * Real time used
                * Time limits
                * account numbers
                * Process numbers
            * I/O status info: list of I/O devices allocated to the process, a list of open files
        *
